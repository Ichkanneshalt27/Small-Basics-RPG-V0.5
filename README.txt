README

Importend: You need to download the exe and dll file for the game to working. (Both need to be in the same folder)
The sb file is just small basic file format + there if you want to chekc the code.

This is a small not finished RPG in small basics

The Game should work now fine as it is.

some things aren't 100% finished like coloring action and enemy ki.

Everything is in german. Perhaps I translate it at some one point.

Up to 18 enemies, some option what to do, 2 Boss / 3 floor to explore, everything text based.
